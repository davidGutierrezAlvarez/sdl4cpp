FAQ
Q: Why another SDL->C++ Wrapper?/Why not just use/improve upon SDLmm?
A: I wanted to make my own, and because choice is a good thing. Don't
   like how I wrapped SDL, use SDLmm instead. Don't like how SDLmm does
   something, make your own or change what's out there.

Q: Why not just use SDL the way it is?
A: First, I think C++ allows code to be written cleaner in many cases.
   Second, I like not having to worry about memory usage. Many C programmers
   that use C++ will use many new's and deletes. While this dosn't normally
   hurt things, it can make code harder to manage down the road (unless it's
   well kept in classes that deal with the cleanup.) Also, if not done very
   carefully, memory leaks can be there. For these reasons, I wrap SDL into
   classes when I thought needed, and almost always used referances instead of
   pointers.
