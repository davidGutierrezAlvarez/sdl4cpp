* Basic build method
Make a build directory (cd SDL4Cpp; mkdir build)
run cmake <directory to SDL4Cpp source> (cmake ..)
compile (make)

* Changing options
Options that are changable are:
ENABLE_DOXYGEN "Enable building of documentation"
GENERATE_DOCS "Build documentation on every build"
ENABLE_TESTS "Build test programs"
ENABLE_MIXER "Build with SDL_mixer support"
ENABLE_IMAGE "Build with SDL_image support"

These can be configured via cmake -D<OPTION>:bool=true|false
ccmake can be used as an alternative.

* IDE's
Cmake supports exporting to several IDE's. On UNIX enviornments it's typically
Code::Blocks, Kdevelop 3, and Eclipse. Windows has options for at least Visual
Studio. The option is usually something like
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
or
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"
